# jsme-react

This project wraps the BSD licensed [JSME molecule editor](https://peter-ertl.com/jsme/) (by B. Bienfait and P. Ertl) in a React component for easy use in React apps.

Please note that JSME was originally developed in Java and transpiled and you have to manually include it with a script tag in your HTML's head - this NPM library can't depend on it correctly and let your bundler take care of it because of how the JSME javascript is loaded.

## How to use

#### Step one: add a script tag to your HTML to load the upstream original or a local copy:

```html
<script src="https://peter-ertl.com/jsme/JSME_2017-02-26/jsme/jsme.nocache.js"></script>
```

#### Step two: add this library to your project

```bash
yarn add jsme-react
# or
npm install --save jsme-react
```

#### Step three: use the react component

```javascript
import Jsme from 'jsme'

export default class App extends Component {
  logSmiles(smiles) {
    console.log(smiles)
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Jsme height="300px" width="400px" options="oldlook,star"  onChange={this.logSmiles}/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

## Props

Required props

* `height`: string, e.g. "300px"
* `width`: string, e.g. "400px"

Optional props
* `options`: string that is a comma separated string of JSME options. The available options are described on the [JSME documentation page](https://peter-ertl.com/jsme/JSME_2017-02-26/doc.html#JSME_API)
* `onChange`: event handler that is passed the smiles whenever it is changed in the editor
* `smiles`: the smiles to display (when not set an empty canvas will be shown)


# Development

Open two terminals, in one do `npm start` at the root level, in the other `npm start` in the example directory.
